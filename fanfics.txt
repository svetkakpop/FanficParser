Description: Draco would accept his wand from Potter, thank him, and leave. That was how it should be. He and Potter were destined to remain ex-rivals, with nothing in common anymore. Once Draco left this house, he would only see Potter in the newspapers, and perhaps, in a few years, they might cross paths by chance—exchange polite nods, and then go their separate ways.Except… Draco couldn’t leave.He was cursed. Of course, he was. He should’ve known something like this would happen—because this was his life.And it had all started with an owl—and Potter’s terrible, utterly appalling handwriting.

Description: Hay un principio muggle que Draco Malfoy cree que describe su vida a la perfección: la ley de Murphy. Según este principio empírico, "si algo puede salir mal, seguramente saldrá mal". Y, francamente, Draco estaba convencido de que alguna identidad cósmica se estaba riendo de él desde que tuvo uso de razón.  Los hechos hablaban por sí solos.Cuando intentó hacer amigos, terminó mal. Muy mal.Quiso ir a Beauxbatons con Jason y Theo, pero no, claro que no. Acabó en Hogwarts. Y solo.Quiso mantenerse alejado de Harry Potter y, ¿adivinen qué? El imbécil de Gryffindor lo arrojó de su escoba.Planeó pasar Yule tranquilamente en casa con sus amigos, pero no, terminó castigado en el castillo por culpa de Potter.Pero, de entre todos esos infortunios, uno sobresalía como el epicentro de su desgracia: Harry maldito Potter. Porque, desde el momento en que puso un pie en Hogwarts, todo empeoró. ¿Coincidencia? Draco lo dudaba. Era como si Potter tuviera una conexión mágica con su mala suerte, una especie de imán que hacía que todo lo que podía salir mal, saliera aún peor.Así que, si algo estaba claro en la vida de Draco Malfoy, era esto: nada en su vida salía como él quería.
